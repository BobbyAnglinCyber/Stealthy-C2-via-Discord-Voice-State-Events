## üåÄ Project Overview
A proof-of-concept exploring how Discord can be abused as a command-and-control (C2) channel.  
The PoC uses a lightweight Python bot that watches voice-state changes as a signaling mechanism. The goal: generate realistic host + network telemetry and demonstrate detection approaches using **Sysmon**, **Suricata**, and **Wireshark**.

Why Discord? It‚Äôs widely used, increasingly present in workplaces, and its encrypted WebSocket (WSS) traffic easily blends with legitimate activity ‚Äî making it an attractive channel for stealthy C2 and an interesting detection challenge for defenders.

## üõ† Tools & Environment (At a Glance)
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux (attacker scripts / bot controller)  
- **Victim:** Windows 10 VM (developer workstation running the PoC agent)  
- **Detection Stack:** Sysmon (SwiftOnSecurity config recommended), Suricata (eve.json), Wireshark (pcap visualization)  
- **PoC Code:** Python + discord.py (bot uses official API; **bot token only**, never user tokens)  

Design note: the stack is intentionally minimal ‚Äî a ‚Äúlow to the ground‚Äù view that emphasizes raw system + network telemetry rather than pre-aggregated SIEM alerts.

## üéØ At-a-Glance TTPs (MITRE mapping)
| Tactic (MITRE ATT&CK)    | Technique (short)                         | ID / Label  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Command & Control        | Application Layer Protocols (Web)         | **T1071.001** |
| Command & Control        | Web Service                               | **T1102**   |
| Execution                | Command execution via bot commands        | **T1059**   |
| Defense Evasion / C2     | Encrypted channel (WSS/TLS)               | **T1573**   |

**Proposed / Related event-driven behaviors** (candidates for sub-techniques):  
- **Event-driven beaconing** ‚Äî agent signals only in response to local events (voice-state change, file event, etc.).  
- **Voice-state signaling** ‚Äî using Discord voice-state updates (join/leave/mute/unmute) as a low-bandwidth trigger channel for C2.

> These ‚Äúproposed‚Äù items reflect behaviors exercised in the lab and are offered as candidate sub-techniques or detection categories (not official ATT&CK entries).

## üß© Code Walkthrough
High-level flow (core logic, not full implementation details):

```text
1. Bot starts ‚Üí connects to/watches Discord server
2. Any User Joins specified Voice Channel (admin)
3. Bot executes locally on victim (Text File Creation/Open Notepad, Create Registry Run Key, System Discovery commands)
4. Captures command output
5. Sends result back over Discord (WSS)
```

## üõ° Why This Matters for Defenders (TL;DR)

- **Opaque traffic** ‚Äî Discord uses TLS/WSS over Cloudflare; network signatures are weak.  
- **Shared infrastructure** ‚Äî IP/domain blocking causes collateral damage.  
- **Minimal defender telemetry** ‚Äî APIs are designed for bot functionality, not security observability.  

**Practical takeaway:** defenders must correlate host (**Sysmon/EDR**) + network (**Suricata/pcap**) telemetry to detect abuse. Collaboration platforms could help by exposing *limited, privacy-preserving* telemetry (e.g., beacon metadata, voice-state events) to improve defender visibility.
